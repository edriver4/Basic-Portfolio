      <img src="assets/images/cat.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>My name is Bradley and I am currently an employee at athenaHealth. I have a English Golden Retriever and his name is Charlie. Charlie is that white fluff-ball in the picture above. Anyways back to me, I am a huge University of Georgia football fan...which is very ironic since I am technically a student of the Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp here at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Talk about an internal conflict! But the reason why I choose to do this program is because I wanted to change my career path towards something where I can benefit and impact the rest of the world. Or you can just say that I love coding and think is very intriguing.</p>

      <p>What do I like to do for fun? I really enjoy hanging out with my friends. My friends are my life, so without them I would feel lost. I have a great friend group. I also enjoy working out, I am a bit of a health nut really and enjoy fitness. Another thing that I like to do is play videogames, especially COD and Fortnite. Even though I am completely terrible at Fornite, it is still fun to play with my friends. I also enjoy spending time with my dog Charlie. Some other hobbies of mine are: spending time with my family, fishing, watching sports, going to Church, being outside, and the beach.</p>
