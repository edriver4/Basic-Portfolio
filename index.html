<!-- Paragraphs about me -->
        <p>My name is Bradley and I am currently an employee at athenaHealth.  I have a English Golden Retriever and his name is Charlie. Charlie is that white fluff-ball in the picture above. Anyways back to me, I am a huge University of Georgia football fan...which is very ironic since I am technically a student of the Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp here at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  Talk about an internal conflict!  But the reason why I choose to do this program is because I wanted to change my career path towards something where I can benefit and impact the rest of the world. Or you can just say that I love coding and think is very intriguing.</p>
        
        <p>What do I like to do for fun?  I really enjoy hanging out with my friends.  My friends are my life, so without them I would feel lost.  I have a great friend group.  I also enjoy working out, I am a bit of a health nut really and enjoy fitness.  Another thing that I like to do is play videogames, especially COD and Fortnite.  Even though I am completely terrible at Fornite, it is still fun to play with my friends.  I also enjoy spending time with my dog Charlie. Some other hobbies of mine are: spending time with my family, fishing, watching sports, going to Church, being outside, and the beach.</p>
